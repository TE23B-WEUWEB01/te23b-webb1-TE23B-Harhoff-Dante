                    Jupiter system in 1995-97. The distinct bright ray crater at the bottom of the image is the Tycho impact
                    basin.</p>

                <p>During the total solar eclipse, the Sunâ€™s corona, only visible during the total eclipse, is shown as a
                    crown of white flares from the surface. The red spots called Bailey's beads occurs where the moon grazes
                    by the Sun and the rugged lunar limb topography allows beads of sunlight to shine through in some areas. </p>
